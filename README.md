# News-Times 

This is a personal project to create a news portal website inspired by the New York Times. The website utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive news browsing experience.

## Live Site 

This project is now hosted on Netlify. You can view the live site at [https://news-times-rsp0225.netlify.app/](https://news-times-rsp0225.netlify.app/). 

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to create the News-Times:

- HTML: The structure and layout of the webpage were created using HTML.
- CSS: The styling of the webpage was implemented using CSS.
- JavaScript: JavaScript is used to provide the to-do-list's logic and to make features interactive.
- Bootstrap: The layout, styling, and responsive design of the webpage were created using Bootstrap.
- API: The News Catcher API (https://docs.newscatcherapi.com/api-docs/endpoints/search-news) is used to fetch news articles. However, the API only provides 50 free requests per month.
- Moment.js: It is an open source library for displaying relative dates
